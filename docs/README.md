# Documentation

This folder contains the material needed to generate the documentation using Sphinx.

## Generation

In order to generate the documentation, we need to have the package dependencies installed, preferably, in a virtual environment.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When everything is installed, we should be able to generate the html docs.

```
make html
```
